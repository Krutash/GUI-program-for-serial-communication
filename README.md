# GUI-program-for-serial-communication
 The GUI program was designed to assist a in house developed chromatogram for data collection and data analysis. The developed software can help communicate with the device. I have attached the complete script for the software but most of the machine dependent libraries are there in the IGCAR research lab, so the online mode (data collection from prototype) will not work. However other analysis modes and functionalities will work.
